First we define the input out format

Then we store the data
    data/train/name_project/a1.csv, a2.csv, a3.csv ...
    data/test/name_project/a1.csv, a2.csv, a3.csv ...

Then we define the model we are using
    models/name_project/model.py

    model must implement train and test method
    as well as set data method

    SetDataMethod
        add links to every relevant file which needs to be
        processed for training / testing

        Model class should define how files are processed

Presentation tools
    save question and labels to a new csv file

To run demo :
    python run_labelling.py name_project

For exact Model architecture, refer to the doc present in the "models" folder
